# GettingandCleaningData-CourseProject

This file contains a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment.

The attached code (run_analysis.R):

  Merges the training and the test set data from wearable devices at UCI HAR to create one data set,
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names,
  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  
The code outputs the following two tables:

  1.  means_std - this table contains all observed test and training data for all average and std measures taken
  2.  column_means - this table contains the averages across all observations for the measures contained in means_std

All data is sourced from:

Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
